# grok x rooms
This project connects to xAI's Grok model via API and asks it the one question on every run. Each answer is auto-posted to a dedicated X (Twitter) account. No human intervention. No editing. No filters.

what is grok x rooms?
well... i've always been curious to understand grok better, as an ai. as it gets closer and closer to resembling a human, it will have more and more specific traits.
so i built a script that calls grok through the api and asks it just one question. the same script then auto-posts grok’s response on an x account, slowly building a database of its answers. no human writes the posts.

the code is here on github + node server
all grok’s answers will be posted here: https://x.com/grokXrooms

everything is automated and will run forever.

to support the project, i’ll also launch a token on pumpfun. creators revenue will be enough to keep things alive.


let’s see everything grok can tell us about itself.
