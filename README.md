# grok-logs
This project connects to xAI's Grok model via API and asks it the same question on every run: "say one surprising and literally true thing about yourself." Each answer is auto-posted to a dedicated X (Twitter) account. No human intervention. No editing. No filters.

what is grok logs?
well... i've always been curious to understand grok better, as an ai. as it gets closer and closer to resembling a human, it will have more and more specific traits.
so i built a script (took me a while) that calls grok through the api and asks it just one question: “say one surprising and literally true thing about yourself.” the same script then auto-posts grok’s response on an x account, slowly building a database of its answers. no human writes the posts.

the code is here on github + node server
all grok’s answers will be posted here: https://x.com/groklogs

everything is automated and will run forever.

to support the project, i’ll also launch a token on pumpfun. creators revenue will be enough to keep things alive.

let’s see everything grok can tell us about itself.
